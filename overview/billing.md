# Billing

At Kumu, we use an automated billing system to accept payments for [paid plans](/overview/accounts-and-plans.html). Plans can be billed on either a monthly or annual basis, and if you choose to be billed on an annual basis, you'll receive a 20% discount.

We handle all payments with [full PCI-compliance](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/) through [Stripe](https://stripe.com/), the industry standard, and you can use any credit card that is [accepted by Stripe](https://stripe.com/payments/payment-methods-guide#cards). We do not store any sensitive billing information on our own servers.

To change the credit card you use with a personal account, you can visit the [billing section of your account settings](https://kumu.io/settings#billing). For [organizations](/guides/organizations.md), you can go to your [organization's dashboard](/overview/dashboard.html#organization-dashboard) and scroll down to the billing section.

#### Monthly billing

If you are on a monthly billing cycle, Kumu will bill your account each month based on the number of private projects you own. For personal accounts, each private project costs $9/month, and for organizations, each private project costs $20/month. Organizations are billed an additional $10 membership fee each month.

To add more private projects to a monthly personal account or organization, you simply need to create a new project from your [dashboard](/overview/dashboard.html), and set it to **Private**.

To remove private projects from the monthly bill, personal accounts can [delete the projects](/faq/how-do-i-delete-a-project.html), and organizations can either [delete](/faq/how-do-i-delete-a-project-map-or-view.html) or [archive](/guides/archiving-projects.html) the projects.

When your bill is increased or decreased during a billing cycle, Kumu's billing system **prorates** the final charge based on the amount of time left in your cycle, and incorporates the proration into the next bill.


#### Annual billing

If you are on an annual billing cycle, Kumu will bill your account once per year based on a pre-set private project limit, **not** the actual number of private projects you own.

This means that deleting and archiving private projects _will not_ reduce your annual bill; they will only make more private projects available under your total private project limit.

However, you can increase or decrease your private project limit at any time during the year, and this _will_ increase or decrease your next bill. To adjust your private project limit, go to the billing settings for your personal account or organization, and use the interface to add or subtract private projects.

When your bill is increased or decreased during a billing cycle, Kumu's billing system **prorates** the final charge based on the amount of time left in your cycle, and charges the card on file immediately.

<p class="alert alert-warning">
When you increase your private project limit on an annual plan, a prorated charge will be billed immediately to the credit card on file. If you need to pay by invoice instead of by credit card, please <a class="alert-link" href="mailto:support@kumu.io">reach out Kumu support</a> before increasing your project limit.
</p>


#### Enterprise billing

If you're using the [Enterprise version of Kumu](/overview/accounts-and-plans.html#enterprise-version), you'll be billed according to how many users you have, instead of how many projects you have. Enterprise customers are billed annually, and seats are sold in packs of 5 users.


## Payment receipts

Our billing system automatically sends a receipt to the email on file each time a payment is made. From time to time, these receipts might get sent to your email's spam folderâ€”if you don't see a receipt, be sure to check there first.

For a personal account, if you want to change the email that receipts are sent to, you can go to the [profile section of your account settings](https://kumu.io/settings#profile). To do this for an organization, you can go to your [organization's dashboard](/overview/dashboard.html#organization-dashboard) and scroll down to profile section.


## Paying by invoice

If you can't enter a credit card into Kumu's website for repeat billing, you can pay by invoice instead. An invoice will allow you to make a one-time payment via credit card, ACH transfer, or a check in the mail.

To request an invoice, you can [email support@kumu.io](mailto:support@kumu.io).


## Seeing multiple charges?

If you see multiple charges from Kumu on your credit card in one month, you might be subscribed to both a personal and an organization plan. To see if this is case, go to your [personal billing settings](https://kumu.io/settings#billing) and the billing section of your [organization's dashboard](/overview/dashboard.html#organization-dashboard) to see all active plans.

<p class="alert alert-info">
  If you have a free personal account, you can still view and edit an organization's projects, as long as you have been <a class="alert-link" href="/guides/organizations.html#adding-users-to-an-organization">given access</a>.
</p>

You also might see multiple charges in the same month if a free trial ended before you had added a credit card to your billing settings.

If these reasons don't apply to you, but you're still seeing multiple charges, please [email support@kumu.io](mailto:support@kumu.io), and we'll help you find and fix the issue!


## Free trials

When you sign up for Kumu, you automatically receive a 14-day free trial of private projects. At any time during your free trial, you can add a credit card to your billing settings to start a subscription plan as soon as the free trial ends.

If you haven't added a credit card before the free trial ends, your private projects will be locked (you won't be able to view or edit them), and Kumu will prompt you to make your projects public or update your billing settings in order to unlock.
