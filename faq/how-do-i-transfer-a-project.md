# How do I transfer a project?

Within Kumu you can either transfer a project to another user's personal account, or to an [organization](/guides.organizations.html).

<p class="alert alert-info">
Currently, only the Kumu core team can transfer projects from organizations to personal accounts. If you need to transfer from an organization to a personal account, please <a class="alert-link" href="mailto:support@kumu.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contact support</a>.
