# How do I add contributors?

## Personal Projects
To add contributors, go to the [project settings](/overview/settings.html#locations-of-the-various-settings-menus) in the top left corner of the map and then click "Members". Then, type the person's name or username and click "add contributor."

## Organization Projects
If you are trying to add a contributor to a project owned by an organization, visit the [dashboard](https://kumu.io/dashboard) and then switch to the settings for the organization. Then follow these three steps:

1. Add the person to the organization (as a guest, member or owner)
2. Assign that person to a team
3. Make sure the team has access to the relevant project (either view or edit access)
