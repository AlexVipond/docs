# How do I keep elements from moving?

### Temporarily pause element movement

If you'd like to **temporarily** stop moving elements in your map, press the `spacebar` on your keyboard. Press `spacebar` again and they will go back to floating.

### Permanently pin elements in place

If you'd like to **permanently** stop all elements from moving, you'll want to pin elements in place. Do this by pressing `A` on your keyboard to select all elements, then click the pin icon in the left side panel, or press `P` on your keyboard. This will pin all existing elements in place.

### More layout options

For more information about layout options, or to set the default element behavior (fixed vs. floating) check out the guides on the [fixed layout](/guides/layouts/fixed.md) and [force-directed layout](/guides/layouts/force-directed.md).
