# How do i make sense of my receipt?

Most of the time, your monthly Kumu receipt will be very straightforward, listing the number of private projects you own, and the total charge they incur.

But, if you add or remove multiple private projects in a single billing period, our system ([Stripe](https://stripe.com/)) creates receipts that can be confusing! This guide will help you make sense of those confusing receipts.

The most important thing to know is that any time you add or remove private projects, our system will take two actions:
- Give you a pro-rated **credit** for all the private projects you previously had
- Incur a pro-rated **charge** for the new total number of private projects

**Credits** appear on your receipt as "Unused time on private projects after [the date you removed the private project]". **Charges** appear as "Remaining time on private projects after [the date you removed the private project]".

A charge for the new total number of private projects. The charge is also prorated to reflect the amount of time left on your month-long billing cycle. This is called "Remaining time" on receipts.
Here's how that concept applies to the invoice pictured above:
This billing cycle renews on the 11th of each month
On April 20th, the account owner added one private project. Rather than charging them the full $18/month price for two private projects, our system created a prorated charge of $12.19 until the 11th of the upcoming month, and labelled it "Remaining time".
Similarly, the account owner had already paid $9 for one of the private projects between April 11 - April 20. Therefore, our system deducted a prorated charge of $6.09 since the 11th of April, and labelled it "Unused time".
Then finally, the normal charge of $18 was added on May 11th  for the upcoming month of 2 private projects, according to their usual billing cycle.
We show these details in your invoice to be transparent about your usage. So you can clearly see how much you have been reimbursed, and how much you have left per private project. 




Here is a trickier example, should I include it as an advanced example and repeat the steps above?)



I donâ€™t believe there is a difference between monthly billing and annual billing in terms of how it shows up in the invoice correct? If an annual invoice is corrected, it will show the same, right?
