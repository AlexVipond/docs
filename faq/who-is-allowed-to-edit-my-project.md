# Who is allowed to edit my project?

You, as the project owner, have full control over who's allowed to edit a project, regardless of whether the project is public or private. Although public projects can be accessed by anyone, only contributors [added to the project](/faq/how-to-add-contributors.md) by the owner will be able to edit them.

With personal projects, all contributors have edit access. If you want to restrict some people to have view-only access, check out our [Organizations](/guides/organizations.md), which give you more fine-grained control over access.
