# Single sign-on

Single sign-on (an exclusive feature for [organizations](/guides/organizations.html)) allows members of your Kumu organization to sign into Kumu with one set of login credentials—in other words, they won't have to create and remember a new username and password specifically for Kumu.

You can manage your single sign-on settings from your [organization's dashboard](/overview/dashboard.html#organization-dashboard).

<p class="alert alert-warning">
  Azure AD is the only SAML 2.0 provider supported in Kumu at this time—it's not possible to use other services for single sign-on.
