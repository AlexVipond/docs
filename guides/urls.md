# URLs

Kumu URLs follow a predictable pattern: every URL starts with `https://kumu.io` and ends with one of the options described in the table below. When you're visiting Kumu links or sending them to your friends, colleagues, and collaborators, this table will help you know exactly what you're linking to.

Before you dive in: if you're not sure what we mean by `slug` in the table below, check out [our full guide on slugs](/guides/slugs.html).

| Link's destination | URL format |
| --- | --- |
| Your personal dashboard | `/dashboard` |
| Your personal settings | `/settings` |
| An organization's dashboard and settings | `/<organization username>/settings` |
| A public Kumu profile | `/<username>` |
| A Kumu project | `/<project owner's username>/<project name slug>` |
| A specific map in a project | `/<project owner's username>/<project name slug>#<map name slug>` |
| A specific map with a specific view applied | `/<project owner's username>/<project name slug>#<map name slug>/<view name slug>` |
| A specific element or loop in a map, with the default view applied | `/<project owner's username>/<project name slug>#<map name slug>/<element or loop label slug>` |
| A specific element or loop in a map, with a different view applied (not the default view) | `/<project owner's username>/<project name slug>#<map name slug>/<view name slug>/<element or loop label slug>` |


<!-- TODO: ## URL Parameters -->
<!-- If/when we implement URL params that can pre-select control options, that will be documented here -->
<!-- Lightbox and Focus should be documented here -->
